# TRANSLATIONS - Ampache Translation Guide

The official way to send in translations is via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/ampache/ampache/dashboard/).

## Introduction

If you are interested in translating Ampache into a new language or updating
an existing translation.

* Everything can be managed in a central location.
* Translations are updated in a single commit without conflicts.
* The current translation state is available to the team to understand the status of each language.
